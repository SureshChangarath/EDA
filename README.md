In today's fast-paced and interconnected world, maintaining health has become more crucial than ever. The rapid advancements in technology, globalization, and urbanization have made our lives increasingly busy, often causing us to overlook our physical and mental well-being. Health, however, is more than just the absence of diseaseâ€”it is a holistic state of physical, mental, and social well-being. It serves as the cornerstone for leading a fulfilling and productive life.
This project focuses on understanding how lifestyle factors contribute to obesity. Obesity management often begins with lifestyle changes, emphasizing the adoption of a balanced diet and regular physical activity. A healthy diet typically includes an appropriate balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats while being low in sugar, saturated fats, and processed foods.
By analyzing data related to lifestyle habits and their correlation with obesity, this project aims to provide insights into how specific choices influence health outcomes. The findings will shed light on actionable strategies for effective obesity management and overall well-being.
